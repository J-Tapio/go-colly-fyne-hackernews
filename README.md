# The HackerNews GUI

## What is this project?

This is a small project where I wanted to learn use of both [Colly](http://go-colly.org) and [Fyne](https://fyne.io) to create a GUI app which shows latest news from [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com).

Currently app updates latest news from the main site every 30 minutes. Might also include older news later.

### Demo

### Todo

- Include older news than the latest from the main site
